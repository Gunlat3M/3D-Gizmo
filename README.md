3D Gizmo Logo. The Gizmo is the universal tool for 3D artists, architects, and designers in nearly every 3D program out there.

We suggested the idea of using the Gizmo as our main logo for our major. Made a quick mockup of the design, and the logo came out nicely, albeit incredibly disorganized.
At the request of our professor, the logo has been put up for all to edit and use.

Use it as much as you want, but please attribute it. We cannot be held liable for anything whilst using this file.
